    <p><strong>Sean Miller</strong>, Ontario, has been jailed for seven years and three months, alongside up to three years of supervised release, after breaking into a county jail's systems.

            As reported by Bleeping Computer, Sean was attempting to tamper with prisoner records in order to have an associate released early.
            
            The 27-year-old must also pay $235,488 in costs to Washtenaw County. This amount is reported to be the full cost of investigating and addressing the security breach.</p>
