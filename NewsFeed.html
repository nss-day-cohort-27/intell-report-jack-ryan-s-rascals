        <h3>Hackers Steal $60 Million from Taiwanese Bank; One Suspect
            <strong>Sean Miller</strong> Arrested</h3>
        <P>A Taiwanese bank has become the latest to fall victim to hackers siphoning off millions of dollars by targeting the
            backbone of the world financial system, SWIFT. SWIFT, or Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunication, is
            a global financial messaging system that thousands of banks and commercial organizations across the world use
            to transfer billions of dollars every day. Hackers reportedly last week managed to steal almost $60 Million from
            Far Eastern International Bank in Taiwan by planting malware on the bank's servers and through the SWIFT interbank
            banking system</P>
        <p>According to Taiwanese state-owned news agency Central News Agency, most of the stolen money has now been recovered,
            with only $500,000 remaining, and authorities have made two arrests in connection with the bank cyber-heist.
            Far Eastern on Friday admitted that some unknown hackers managed to install malware on computers and servers
            within its organization, and most crucially, onto a SWIFT terminal employed by the bank.</p>

                    <strong>Sean Miller</strong>, Ontario, has been jailed for seven years and three months, alongside up to three
                    years of supervised release, after breaking into a county jail's systems. As reported by Bleeping Computer,
                    Sean was attempting to tamper with prisoner records in order to have an associate released early. The
                    27-year-old must also pay $235,488 in costs to Washtenaw County. This amount is reported to be the full
                    cost of investigating and addressing the security breach.</p>

                <h3>Deloitte hacked:Cyber attack expose client's E-mail</h3>
                <p>Another day, another data breach. This time one of the world's "big four" accountancy firms has fallen victim
                    to a sophisticated cyber attack. Global tax and auditing firm Deloitte has confirmed the company had
                    suffered a cyber attack that resulted in the theft of confidential information, including the private
                    emails and documents of some of its clients. Deloitte is one of the largest private accounting firms
                    in the U.S. which offers tax, auditing, operations consulting, cybersecurity advisory, and merger and
                    acquisition assistance services to large banks, government agencies and large Fortune 500 multinationals,
                    among others.
                </p>
                <p>Hackers managed to gain access to the Deloitte's email server through an administrator account that wasn't
                    secured using two-factor authentication (2FA), granting the attacker unrestricted access to Deloitte's
                    Microsoft-hosted email mailboxes. Besides emails, hackers also may have had potential access to "usernames,
                    passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information."</p>


                <p>Deloitte has become the latest of the victim of the high-profile cyber attack. Just last month, Equifax publicly
                    disclosed a breach of its systems that exposed personal data of as many as 143 million US customers.
                    Moreover, last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also disclosed that hackers managed
                    to hack its financial document filing system and illegally profited from the stolen information</p>
                <p>As part of the review, Deloitte has been in contact with the very few clients impacted and notified governmental
                    authorities and regulators." Deloitte's internal investigation into the cyber incident is still ongoing,
                    and the firm has reportedly informed only six of its clients that their information was "impacted" by
                    the breach.</p>
